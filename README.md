# BlockLists

This repo is mix of my personal block lists and some borrowed from uBlock Origin.
I am a Mac user, and as I am sure other Mac users are aware, Safari no longer supports uBlock.
This is my attempt to take uBlock and make place the lists in a Pi-Hole/general block list friendly manner.
Please feel free to give me feedback.
